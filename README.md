# Playwright UI Tests for SauceDemo

This is a simple UI automation project using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) web app.

## ðŸ’¡ Why this project?

I recently started exploring Playwright after working with Selenium, and I was impressed with how much is already built in â€” from the test runner to parallel execution and trace viewing. This project is my first hands-on attempt using Playwright with JavaScript after just 2 days of learning.

The code may not be perfect, but it's part of my learning journey. Iâ€™m sharing it publicly to grow and improve with feedback and practice.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… End-to-end tests written in JavaScript using Playwright Test  
- ðŸ§ª Uses cookies to avoid repeating login/authentication on every test   (```./helper/auth.helper.ts```)
- ðŸ”„ Integrated with **GitHub Actions** for CI
